## Navigation in the Dashboard

When you open the Inventory System, you’ll land on the Dashboard by default. On the left side, there’s a navigation menu that you can easily show or hide using the toggle button.

The dashboard gives you a quick overview of your inventory performance. You’ll see key stats like Total Revenue, Total Orders, Products in Stock, and Low Stock Alerts. There’s also a helpful revenue trend graph that shows how your sales are doing over time.

In the navigation menu, there are a few other useful pages:

1- Revenue Analysis – This page breaks down profits, margins, and revenue by category so you can keep track of how your business is performing.

2- Inventory Management – Here, you can add new products using the Add Product button. You can also update or edit existing product details to keep everything accurate and up to date.
